# Advent of Code 2025 - Intro

Hey, once again I want to take part in the Advent of Code event in 2025 like in past years. However, I would like to document my experience this year compared to the years before.

I think that I could improve my skills at describing my plans and intent in programming in general which is a very useful skill in both personal and profesionnal projects alike.

In this post, I want outline what I did in preparation for the event. Basically, all the code and scripts to compile and run different solutions for the days. I also tried something different this year to parse the puzzle inputs.

## Build process

### script, compile day only

## Input Pre-Process

### header includes

## Goals of This Year
